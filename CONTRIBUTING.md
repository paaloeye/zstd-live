### **Platform & Architecture**
- `platform:macos` / `platform:linux` / `platform:windows`
- `arch:x86_64` / `arch:aarch64` / `arch:riscv64`

### **Priority Levels**
- `priority:high` - Security fixes, release blockers, critical bugs
- `priority:medium` - Important features, significant improvements
- `priority:low` - Nice-to-have features, minor improvements

### **Status Tracking**
- `status:blocked` - Blocked by external factors
- `status:in-progress` - Currently being worked on
- `status:ready-for-review` - Ready for code review
- `status:needs-testing` - Needs testing and validation

### **Release & Version Management**

## üìù Contribution Guidelines

### **Pull Request Process**

1. **Create Descriptive PR**
   - Clear title following conventional commits
   - Detailed description of changes
   - Link to related issues

2. **Apply Appropriate Labels**
   ```bash
   # Example: Major feature
   gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --add-label "v2.0.0,type:feature,ci/cd,workflow"

   # Example: Platform-specific bug
   gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --add-label "type:bugfix,platform:macos,priority:high"

   # Example: Documentation update
   gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --add-label "documentation,type:maintenance,community"
   ```

3. **Label Assignment Guidelines**
   - **Always include**: At least one `type:*` label
   - **Version labels**: Add `v2.0.0` for milestone-related work
   - **Component labels**: Add relevant technical area labels
   - **Platform labels**: For platform-specific issues
   - **Priority labels**: For issues requiring urgent attention
   - **Status labels**: To track progress through development workflow

### **PR Status Workflow**
```
[Create PR] ‚Üí status:ready-for-review
     ‚Üì
[Issues Found] ‚Üí status:needs-testing / status:blocked
     ‚Üì
[Address Issues] ‚Üí status:ready-for-review
     ‚Üì
[Approved] ‚Üí [Merged]
```

### **Code Standards**

- **Formatting**: Must pass `make check-fmt` (Zig's built-in formatter)
- **Testing**: All new features must include tests
- **Documentation**: Update README.md or CLAUDE.md for significant changes
- **Conventional Commits**: Use conventional commit messages

### **Breaking Changes**
- Always use `breaking-change` label
- Document in commit message with `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
- Provide migration guide in PR description
- Consider if change requires major version bump

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### **For New Contributors**
1. Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue`
2. Comment on the issue to get assigned
3. Follow the development setup above
4. Ask questions in the issue or discussions

### **For Regular Contributors**
1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes following project conventions
3. Run quality checks: `make check`
4. Create PR with proper labels
5. Address review feedback promptly

### **For Maintainers**
1. **Initial Review**: Check proper labeling and description
2. **Technical Review**: Verify code quality, tests, formatting
3. **Build Verification**: Ensure CI/CD passes on all platforms
4. **Documentation Check**: Verify README/CLAUDE.md updates
5. **Release Impact**: Consider if PR affects v2.0.0 milestone
